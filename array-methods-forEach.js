// 1.What does it do? make sure to explain all the parameters. 
// The forEach method loops through the function for each element inside the array.
// The method has a parameter, callback which is the function that is executed for
// the array. It takes in 3 arguments with an option for a this object. The main
// three are the currentValue, the index of the value and the array that it is being applied to. 
//
// 2.Does it edit the current array?
// No it does not.
//
// 3.What does it return?
// Undefined 
//
// 4.How can I use this? Come up (not one off the internet) with a small real world example and explain it.
// You have ten employees, your team just recieved a giant contract and you are going to give them
// each a 2.00 raise. 
//
// 5.Build your real world example.
