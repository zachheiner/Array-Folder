// 1.What does it do? make sure to explain all the parameters. 
//  The reduce method executes a function that reduces each member of the array into a single output.
//  There are two parameters. First is the callBack function which determines what happens to the array.
//  it has four parameters itself, which is the accumulator which holds all the information for the function,
//  the current value, the surrent index, an the array itself. The next intial value is the first argument 
//  that the callBack function will take.
//
// 2.Does it edit the current array?
// No it doesn't.
//
// 3.What does it return?
// It returns a value that is the result of the function. 
//
// 4.How can I use this? Come up (not one off the internet) with a small real world example and explain it.
