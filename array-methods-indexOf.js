// 1.What does it do? make sure to explain all the parameters. 
// indexOf searches the array to find the desired item, it they returns the index value. There are two parameters.
// First is the element that indexOf is searching for. The second is the fromIndex, which denotes at what index you
// will start from.
//
// 2.Does it edit the current array?
// No it doesn't.
//
// 3.What does it return?
// It returns the index of the item found unless it isn't there, then it returns -1. 
//
// 4.How can I use this? Come up (not one off the internet) with a small real world example and explain it.
// You are a teacher and you have a student who will send you the order in which each class mate fell in a stack ranking.
// You are grading and you need to be able to see where people fall in the stack rank.
//
// 5.Build your real world example.
