// 1.What does it do? make sure to explain all the parameters. 
// The includes method searches the array for an element to see if it is included.
// There are two parameters, the first is the element to search for. The second is the
// index at which you want the storage to start. 
//
// 2.Does it edit the current array?
// No it doesn't
//
// 3.What does it return?
// it returns a boolean, so either true if it is there or false if it is not.
//
// 4.How can I use this? Come up (not one off the internet) with a small real world example and explain it.
// You keep your attendance for elders quorum in an array in a program. You want to check to see if 
// someone was in elders quorum. includes allows you to do it.
