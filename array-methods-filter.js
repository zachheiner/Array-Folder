// 1.What does it do? make sure to explain all the parameters. 
// The every method tests wether at least one of the elements in the array pass the test that is implemented
// function that is provided to it. It has 4 parameters. the first is the currentValue meaning 
// element being processed. Second is the index of the current element. Third, is the array that
// it is being called on. Fourth, is thisArg which is a value to use as this when executing the callback.  
//
// 2.Does it edit the current array?
// No it doesn't
//
// 3.What does it return?
// it returns a boolean, so either true if one of the elements pass, or false if one does not.
//
// 4.How can I use this? Come up (not one off the internet) with a small real world example and explain it.
// You need to make sure that that one of classes is at least 4 credits. You have your classes credits stored in an array.
// You can run the program an find out if one of the classes has four credits.

// 5.Build your real world example.
